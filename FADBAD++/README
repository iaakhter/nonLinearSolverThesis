
 FADBAD++ Templates for Automatic Differentiation
 ================================================

   FADBAD++ defines C++ templates for performing automatic differentiation
of functions implemented as C/C++ programs. Three types of automatic
differentiation has been implemented. The forward and the backward methods
are implemented to compute first order derivatives and the Taylor expansion
method is implemented to compute Taylor series expansion.
   All templates are flexible in the way that the arithmetic used in as
template-arguments can be chosen by the user. This way differentiation of 
programs, based on any arithmetic such as: double, interval, multiprecision 
etc. is possible. This flexibility also makes it possible to perform automatic
differentiation on a program which itself uses automatic differentiation.
All three methods can be mixed in an application and the user can obtain 
derivatives using the most optimal combination of methods for the application.

Examples of tested applications:

1) Forward automatic differentiation on a function f : R^n->R^n, evaluated 
   in interval arithmetics, using the BIAS/PROFIL package, to obtain function
   values and derivatives. Used with the interval Newton method to obtain 
   guarenteed enlosures of all solutions to the nonlinear equation f(x)=0. 
    
2) Forward-Backward automatic differentiation on a function f : R^n->R, 
   evaluated in interval arithmetics, using the BIAS/PROFIL package and the 
   backward method to obtain first order derivatives (the gradient) and the 
   forward method to differentiate the first order derivatives to obtain the 
   second order derivatives (the Hessian). Used with the interval Krawczyk 
   method to perform global optimization obtaining a guarenteed enclosure of 
   the global minimum. 

3) Numerical integration of a function f : RxR^n->R, using a
   three-point-two-derivative formula. The Backward method has been used to
   differentiate the Numerical integration program obtaining the n partial 
   derivatives of the integral with respect to the n parameters in the 
   function. 
   
4) Taylor expansion of the solution to an ordinary differential equation, 
   used to solve initial value problems. The Forward method has been used to 
   differentiate the initial value problem solver to obtain the solution of 
   the variational problem.
        
5) Taylor expansion of the solution to an ordinary differential equation 
   using interval arithmetics and using the Forward method to obtain 
   derivatives of the Taylor coefficients with respect to the point of 
   expansion, which are the values of the Taylor coefficients for the 
   solution of the variational problem. Used in a method which solves initial
   value problems with guaranteed enclosures.
